# Python_Project_1

1st python project of ASRBD 2024-2025 at EPSI Grenoble :

Goal here is to build a terminal app with a menu offering different options :

Add a configuration : it is a tool to enter configurations into the system in order to save them and use them to push configurations later in networks
  -> it looks like :
                    Server name : 
                    IP Address : 
                    Operating System :
                    Services running :
                    
Modify a configuration : at first it was solely the IP address modification, but I implemented all the other key/value to make them modifiable as well

Delete a configuration (local)

List all the local configurations

Save configuration into a json

Recover configuration from a json

And the most interesting part is the last option :
    - Nmap port scan from IP address or IP range

I plan to add, a name scan and os detection to the scan
